# climvar : Analysis of Climate (Temperature) Variability for inclusion in PAGE IAM

First, on the UCL geography cluster, do `source activate pangeo` to open the environment with the packages that are needed to open the .nc files (i.e. specifically xarray), and do `source activate uncertainty` if you want to run the parts with an explicit handling of uncertainty.
